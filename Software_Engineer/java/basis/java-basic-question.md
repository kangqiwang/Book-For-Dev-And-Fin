## Java basic concept

### What is Java? Explain its features and benefits

1. platform independent
2. object-oriented
3. automatic
4. rich apis
5. multi-threaded
6. robust and secure
7. open source
8. large developer community

### jvm vs jdk vs jre

jvm (java virtual machine) it interprets the complied java code and executes it on the target platform. JVM responsible for the memory management, garbage collections and security of the java program
JDK(java development kit): it includes all the tools necessary to develop and run java applications. it includes Java compiler, JVM and lib and debugger, profiler and docs. it is used by developer to complie, run and test java programs
JRE(Java runtime environment): it includes the JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files required to run Java applications.


### difference bewteen java and C++

1. Syntax: C++ has more complexsyntax compared to Java, with a focus on pointers and memory management
2. Memory management:C++ require manual memory management using pointers and memory allocation/ deallocation functions
3. platform independence: Java is designed to be plaform-independent, it means that java programs can run on any system with a Java virtual machine(JVM)
4. application areas: C++ commonly used for system-level programming

### Java symbols

1. ~ tilde
2. ! exclamation mark
3. @ At
4. \# Hash
5. ^caret
6. & Ampersand
7. \* Asterisk
8. () parenthesis / brackets
9. \_ underscore / horizontal bar
10. \- dash/ hyphen
11. {} curly brace 
12. | or/ vertical bar
13. [] square bracket
14. / forward slash / solidus
15. \ backslash / reverse solidus
16. : colon
17. ; sime colon
18. " quote/double quote
19. ' single quote / apostrophe
20. , comma
21. . dot/ period/full stop

### Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK

Oracle JDK has a commerical license that requires payment for its use in production environments, while OpenJDK is licensed under the GNU genral public license and can be used for free in any environment


### different java comment

1. single-line comments it start with two forward slashes "//"
2. multi-line comments: it start with "/" and end with "/"
3. javadoc comments: start with /** and end with */, it used to document classes, methods and fields and can be used to generate API docs


### shift operator in java
1. left shift operator << , x<<1 equal to x*2
2. right shift operator >>, x>>1 equal to x/2
3. unsigned right shift operator

### override vs overload

override refers to the process of redefining a method in a subclass that has already been defined in its superclass. when a method is overridden, the implementation i the subclass is used instead of the implementation in the superclass when the method is called on an instance of the subclass.

overload, on the other hand, refers to the process of defining a new method in a class that has the same name as an existing method in the same class (or in its superclass). the new method must have a different signature( different parameters or parameter types) than the existing method.


### java keyword final

the keyword "final" is used to declare a constant, a method, or a class

when used to declare a  constant, the final keyword indicates that the value of the varibale cannot be changed once it has been assigned a value

when used to declare a method, the "final" keyword indicates that the method cannot be overridden by any subclasses

when used to declare a class, the "final" keyword indicates that the class cannot be subclassed.

final keyword in Java is used to indicate that something is immutable and cannot be changed.


### java keyword static

1. static variable
2. static method
3. static nested class

### java differnt type of 

1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. char
6. float
7. double
8. boolean

### different between instance varibales and local variables in Java

1. scope
2. lifetime
3. default values
4. access modifier

### varargs parameter


it simplify the creation of methods that accespt a variable number of arguments,with varags, a single method can handle any number of arguments

## java basic data types

1. byte 8bit integer value
2. short 16 bit integer value
3. int 32 bit integer value
4. long 64 bit
5. float 32 bit
6. double 64 bit
7. char 16 bit
8. boolean
