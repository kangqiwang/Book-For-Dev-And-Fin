## Data Engineering Described

1. fistly, data engineering is SQL-focused. The work and primary storage of the data is in relational databases.
2. secondly, data engineering is Big Data-focused. The work and primary storage like Hadoop, Cassandra, and HBase. All of the data processing is done in Big Data framework like MapReduce, Spark, And Flink.


Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.
